This project focuses on analyzing an online book store’s database using SQL to extract meaningful business insights and support data-driven decision-making. The dataset includes information about books, authors, categories, customers, orders, payments, and reviews.

Using SQL queries, the analysis answers key business questions such as top-selling books, most active customers, revenue trends, inventory status, and customer preferences. Advanced SQL concepts like joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, aggregations, and date functions are used to perform in-depth analysis.
